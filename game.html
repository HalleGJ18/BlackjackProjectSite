			<h2>The Game of Blackjack</h2>
		</div>
		
		<div class="card">
      			<p>The aim of the game in Blackjack (also known as Twenty-One) is to draw cards with a total score as close to 21 as possible 
	      without going over and getting closer to it than the dealer.
	      A score of 21 is called a Blackjack. The player bets on whether they will beat the dealer.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="card">
			<h3>Card Scoring</h3>
			<p>Each card is assigned a score value.</p>
			<img src="card-scores.PNG" alt="Card Values" width="510" height="335">
			<p>All of the cards in a player's hand are added up using these values to see how close it is to 21.</p>
		</div>
				
		<div class="card">
			<h3>Starting the game</h3>
			<p>The players place their bets before the cards are dealt. When all are done, the dealer gives the forst card to the player
			 on their left and so on. After all the players have their first card, the dealer gives on to themself.
			 Then deals the players their second card, then dealing one to themself but face down.</p>
			<h3>A Blackjack</h3>
			<p>If any players get an Ace and a card that scores 10 right off the bat, they have a Blackjack and the
			 dealer pays out 2x their bet immediately.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="card">
			<h3>The Players' turns</h3>
			<p>The player to the left of the dealer get the first turn. They must choose whether to “hit” or “stick” to get as close to 21 as 
			they can without going bust (going over 21). To hit is to ask for another card, to stick is to not ask. 
			The player can hit as many times as they like unless they go bust. When the player either goes bust or decides 
			to stick, it is the turn of the player to their left.</p>
			<h3>The Dealer's turn</h3>
			<p>Once the dealer has served every player, their face down card is turned over. The dealer must stand if their card total is 17 or more, 
			else they must hit. The dealer takes a card until the total reaches at least 17. If the dealer has an ace and if it counts as 11 the 
			total is 17 or more, the dealer must use it as such. The dealer’s actions are automatic and doesn’t have the same options as the player where they can 
			choose their moves.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="card">
			<h3>Split</h3>
			<p>When the first 2 cards are dealt to each player, someone might end up with both being the same face value, i.e.  a pair of Queens or a pair of Eights. 
			If this is the case, then the player can choose to treat them as though they were 2 separate hands- split them. The player would then move the original bet 
			to the hand on the left and match it for the hand on the right. They would then play as normal with the left hand first, then the right. If the player had a 
			pair of aces, they are dealt one more card for each ace and may not hit again. Then if a card with a value of 10 is drawn with an ace, the dealer only pays out 
			equal to the bet, not 1.5 times the value as they would with a normal Blackjack.</p>
			<h3>Double Down</h3>
			<p>If a player’s first 2 cards dealt to them have a total value of 9, 10 or 11, they have the option to double their bet- Double Down. When the player’s turn comes 
			around they can place another bet equal to their original bet and the dealer draws them one card only, which is placed face up. The player then must stand regardless 
			of the total.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="card">
			<h3>Paying Out</h3>
			<p>If the player beats the dealer with a Blackjack, they are paid out 1.5 times their bet. If the player beats the dealer with a hand up to 21 but not a Blackjack, 
			they are paid out an amount equal to their bet. If they lose the dealer takes their bet.</p>
			<p>If the player goes bust then they immediately lose their bet, even if the dealer goes bust too. If the dealer goes bust, then they pay out each player who has a 
			hand still in play. If the dealer’s hand values at 21 or less, any player with a hand valuing higher (but not bust) gets paid, and all those with lower have their bets 
			collected. But if a player and the dealer have the same hand value, a stand-off, the dealer neither collects the bet nor pays out.</p>
