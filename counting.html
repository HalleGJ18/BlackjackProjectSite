			<h2>Card Counting Methods</h2>
		</div>
		
		<div class="card">
      			<p>Card counting is used to track the amounts of high and low cards left in the deck that can be dealt 
			to estimate the player’s advantage. The player is at an advantage when there are more high cards to be dealt 
			so would do better to place a higher bet, then when there are more low cards the player is at a disadvantage and 
			should place a lower bet. This is because when there are high cards in the deck the chance of the player getting a 
			Blackjack increases, but also the chance of the dealer going bust. Then when there are more low cards the player is 
			less likely to get a Blackjack and the dealer probably will not go bust. </p>
			<p>There are many different systems of varying accuracy and complexity but will revolve around keeping a count of 
			the high and low cards. Regardless of the method, card counting does improve the odds of the player against the dealer.</p>
			<p>Counting cards involves assigning values to each card in the deck, then adding and subtracting accordingly from the ‘Running Count’. 
			For each system there will be a pivot point. This is when the count reaches a point at which the deck is in favour of the player. In most 
			systems this point would be at around +3, +4 or +5.</p>
		</div>
			
		<div class="card">
			<h3>High-Low System</h3>
			<p>In this method, a point value is assigned to each card. It is the simplest of this kind, which makes it a level 1 system. This system 
			is balanced, which means that if you were to count every card in a deck it would end up at 0.</p>
			<img src="high-low.PNG" alt="count values for high-low" width="358" height="303">
			<p>The count should start at 0, and as each card is dealt add or subtract the point value assigned to it. So, if the first six cards dealt 
			are 2, Q, 7, 9, 4, 10, 6, then the count would be +1 -1 +0 +0 +1 -1 +1 = +1. This is the Running Count. Divide the Running Count by the 
			approximate number of decks remaining. For example, if the Running Count is +5 and there are 3 decks left to play, the True Count would be 5/3 = 1 1/3  which is roughly 1.</p>
			<p>When the True Count is larger, you should bet more and vice versa. This is because a high count is showing that there are more high cards left 
			in the decks, therefore a greater chance of a high scoring hand. And if the count is low you should bet less because it shows a larger proportion of low cards are left in the decks.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="card">
			<h3>Advanced Omega II System</h3>
			<p>This system was developed by Bryce Carlson and he published it in his 2001 book called Blackjack for Blood. It is a level 2 system which 
			means it is more complicated that High-Low. This system is balanced.</p>
			<img src="omega.PNG" alt="count values for omega II" width="288" height="327">
			<p>The counting structure for this system is more complex that others like High-Low because of the values assigned to the cards, this makes it more difficult 
			for people to learn. The standard rules of card counting still apply for this system, start counting immediately when the cards are shuffled, counting each as 
			they are dealt to the table. Also, that when the count is a high positive number like +4 and higher, the game is in favour of the player. Then when the count 
			is lower like -1, 0 or +1 then the game is in favour of the dealer.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="card">
			<h3>Red Seven System</h3>
			<p>Red Seven is another level 1 system. This system is very similar to Hi-Lo, except that the red 7 has a value of +1 and the black 7 has a value of 0. 
			Red Seven is an unbalanced system, if one whole deck was counted the end total would be +2. </p>
			<img src="red-seven.PNG" alt="count values for red seven system" width="283" height="323">
			<p>What makes Red Seven stand out from other counting systems is that instead of starting the count from zero, the player would multiply the number of decks 
			in play by -2 to find the starting point. For example, in a game using six decks the count would start at -12 (-2 multiplied by 6).</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="card">
			<h3>Wong Halves System</h3>
			<p>Wong Halves is a balanced level 3 card counting system, so it is quite complex. It was created by Stanford Wong (a pseudonym, his actual name is John Ferguson) 
			and explained in his book Professional Blackjack. It is one of the most complicated methods of card counting.</p>
			<img src="wong-halves.PNG" alt="count values for wong halves system" width="256" height="304">
			<p>The use of fractions/decimals is part of what makes Halves more complicated as well as more accurate in counting.</p>
